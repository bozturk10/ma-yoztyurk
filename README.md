# Algorithmic Fidelity of Large Language Models in Generating Synthetic German Public Opinions: A Case Study  

## Abstract  

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for investigating public opinions in recent research. This study investigates the *algorithmic fidelity* of LLMsâ€”their ability to replicate the socio-cultural context and nuanced opinions of human participants. Using open-ended survey data from the German Longitudinal Election Studies (GLES), we prompt different LLMs to generate synthetic public opinions reflective of German subpopulations by incorporating demographic features into the persona prompts and comparing the results to the original survey data.  

Our findings reveal that **Llama2** outperforms other LLMs in representing subpopulations, particularly when opinion diversity within groups is lower. For instance, Llama2 demonstrates higher accuracy in reflecting opinions of supporters of left-leaning parties such as *The Greens* and *The Left* but struggles with right-leaning groups like *AfD*. Variations in prompting, including the inclusion or exclusion of specific variables, significantly affect the model's predictions.  

These results highlight the need for improvements in LLM alignment to robustly model diverse public opinions while reducing political biases.
